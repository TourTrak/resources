If you lost something, ask a representative at the Information Center at the Finish Festival if anybody turned it in. You can also email Bike New York with a description of the item and a note about where you think you lost it. When all items are turned in, we will contact you if we find it. The TD Five Boro Bike Tour and Bike New York are not responsible for lost or stolen items. Check at Information Tents at Rest Areas for items lost along the way.  After May 4th, call 212-870-2080 or email info@bikenewyork.org in case your lost items were brought to the Tour office.",
