If you don’t want to go to Queens, travel straight on 63rd Street after the Tour exits the FDR Drive. Do not take the left-hand turn onto the ramp of the Queensboro (59th Street) Bridge. You can also exit the Tour at approximately mile 27, at the Brooklyn Bridge. Just before the Tour enters the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE), you can leave the Tour and take the Brooklyn Bridge bike path into downtown Manhattan. Marshals on the Brooklyn side will direct you.
